## About Page

The `About` page is a dynamic, scroll-driven experience that presents information in three distinct sections. It intelligently tracks the user's scroll position to reveal each section sequentially.

### Key Features

* **Scroll-Triggered Sections**: The page is divided into three main sections, each corresponding to a full viewport height. As the user scrolls, the page transitions smoothly between these sections.
* **Dynamic Header**: The "thefabgen" header remains fixed at the top, but its visibility and color dynamically change based on which section is currently active and whether the introductory animation has finished.
* **Sequential Display**: The sections are designed to stack, with each section appearing "fixed" at the top of the viewport when active. As you scroll past one section, the next one comes into view and becomes active.
* **Footer Integration**: A `Footer` component is displayed at the very end of the scroll experience, after all three main "About" sections.

## AboutOne Component

The `AboutOne` component serves as the **first section** of the `About` page. It introduces the core concept of "thefabgen" and "The Fabulous Generation."

### Key Features

* **Responsive Text Scaling and Translation**: As the user scrolls through this section, the text content within `AboutOne` scales down and translates upward. This creates a subtle parallax-like effect, indicating progress through the section.
* **Dynamic Sizing**: The scaling and translation effects are adjusted based on the screen width to ensure a consistent visual experience across various devices.

## AboutSky Component

The `AboutSky` component represents the **second section** of the `About` page. It delves into the astrological and historical context behind "The Fabulous Generation."

### Key Features

* **Responsive Text Scaling and Translation**: Similar to `AboutOne`, the text content in `AboutSky` also scales down and translates upward as the user scrolls, providing a sense of progression.
* **Dynamic Sizing**: The scaling and translation effects are responsively adjusted for different screen widths.

## AboutFabMama Component

The `AboutFabMama` component is the **third and final main section** of the `About` page. It introduces AnneMarie, the founder, and her vision for "thefabgen."

### Key Features

* **Responsive Text Scaling and Translation**: The text content within `AboutFabMama` also scales down and translates upward as the user scrolls, maintaining the consistent visual flow.
* **Dynamic Sizing**: The scaling and translation effects are responsive to various screen sizes.
* **Founder's Message**: This section provides a personal touch, introducing AnneMarie and her inspiration behind creating "thefabgen." It includes links to related platforms.

## Understanding the Scroll and Transition Logic

The `About` page uses a combination of `scrollProgress`, `activeSection` state, and `useEffect` to manage the scroll-based transitions:

* The `handleScroll` function calculates `scrollProgress` (a value between 0 and 1) for the currently active section.
* It determines the `activeSection` based on how far the user has scrolled relative to the viewport height (`vh`).
* Each "About" component receives `transitionProgress` as a prop, which dictates how much its internal content should scale and translate.
* The `positioning` (`fixed` vs. `relative`) and `marginTop` styles on the section `div` elements are crucial for creating the stacked, sequential scrolling effect. When a section is active, it's `fixed` to the top. As the previous section scrolls away, the `marginTop` for the subsequent section adjusts to bring it into view.

This setup allows for a unique and engaging presentation of information, where content progressively reveals itself as the user scrolls down the page.
