## useMailchimpSubscribe Hook

The `useMailchimpSubscribe` is a **custom React hook** designed to handle newsletter subscriptions to a Mailchimp audience. It encapsulates the logic for submitting an email address to Mailchimp's API and provides state feedback on the subscription process.

### Key Features

* **Mailchimp API Integration**: It constructs a `FormData` object with the user's email and a hidden field (likely a Mailchimp-specific identifier), then sends a `POST` request to a predefined Mailchimp subscription URL.
* **Subscription Function (`subscribe`)**: Provides a `subscribe` function that takes an email address as an argument. When called, it attempts to submit the email to the Mailchimp list.
* **Status and Message Feedback**: Manages and exposes two pieces of state:
    * `status`: Indicates the current state of the subscription attempt (`null`, `"success"`, or `"error"`).
    * `message`: Provides a user-friendly message corresponding to the `status` (e.g., "You're subscribed!", "Subscription failed. Please try again.").
* **Automatic Message Clearing**: Uses `useEffect` to automatically clear the `status` and `message` after 3 seconds, ensuring the feedback `Toast` (if used) disappears gracefully.
* **"No-Cors" Mode**: The `fetch` request is configured with `mode: "no-cors"`. This is a common practice for direct Mailchimp form submissions, as Mailchimp typically uses a different domain for its submission endpoint, and `no-cors` allows the browser to send the request without strict CORS preflight checks, although it means the client-side JavaScript cannot read the response directly (only whether the request was sent successfully).

This hook provides a clean and reusable way to integrate Mailchimp subscription functionality into any React component, abstracting away the underlying API interaction and state management.
